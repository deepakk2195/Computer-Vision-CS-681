<h1>Part1  The significant lines are in red and points in blue. I have chosen images where you can visibly see lines in 0 and 90 degrees and these lines are being drawn by my FindLines()</h1>

<p>the first source image's '0' degree angle with significant lines and points</p>

<p>the first source image's '90' degree angle with significant lines and points</p>

<p>the second source image's '0' degree angle with significant lines and points</p>

<p>the second source image's '90' degree angle with significant lines and points</p>
<img src="Part1_image2_angle90.png" alt="Source image">
<p>the randomly calculated angles are 30 and 45 and you see no resluts due to thresholding</p>

<h1>the second source image's significant points ang lines taking 5 highest peaks and doing α0 ± 5◦</h1>

<p>the fourth part vanishing points for hough lines images and and our FindLines() are almost similar but we get extra points also</p>


<p>the fourth part vanishing points for our FindLines lines images are. They are not perfect but you can see the vanishing point in the middle, in between the other points</p>
